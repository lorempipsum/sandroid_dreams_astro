## Photography Tips

### Best Conditions for Moon Photography

1. **Low Moon**: When the moon is close to the horizon (below 30¬∞), it appears larger and more dramatic
2. **Golden Hour**: Shooting during sunrise or sunset provides warm, soft lighting
3. **Phase Consideration**: 
   - **Crescent moons** (30-70% illuminated) show excellent surface detail
   - **Full moons** are bright but can lose surface texture
   - **New moons** are invisible but perfect for starry landscapes

### Equipment Recommendations

- **Telephoto lens** (200mm+) to capture moon detail
- **Tripod** for sharp images during low light
- **Remote shutter** to minimize camera shake
- **Multiple exposures** for HDR processing

### Timing is Everything

The app identifies three types of opportunities:

- **üåü Optimal**: Multiple favorable conditions align
- **‚≠ê Good**: Some favorable conditions present  
- **üìÖ Fair**: Basic conditions met

Plan your shoots around these calculated times for the best results!
