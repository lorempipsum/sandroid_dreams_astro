# Pointillstic lines

<DummyComponent />

<ImageContainer client:only src={panda.src} />

This is a follow up from my pointillism exploration with plotterbjork. I wasn't too happy with the pointillism, since drawing mere points didn't really differ from just using a poor inkjet printer. So this uses a very similar idea, but instead of points it draws lines! And the results look **great**.

It's evident from afar and even more so close up that this is something a little different than just a printer. The lines have a varying thickness due to how the ink flows, and each start and end point has a bit of a point on it. The lines are biased towards drawing upwards vertically, which gives the Panda a nice hairy look!

<ImageContainer client:only src={panda_closeup.src} />

After the panda came out looking fabulous I went ahead and plotted some other
black and white animals:

<ImageContainer client:only src={orca.src} />

Code modified to bias the lines from left to right, to sell the illusion of movement, and give the orca a _slick_ look.

Full code below without the setup() and helper functions for drawing lines etc.
I've abstracted those out to a different file, so will not be including them each time.

Full code for the sketch:

```
PImage img;
int imageX, imageY, imageW, imageH;
int x, y, i=0;
int lastX = x;
int lastY = y;
int direction = 1;
boolean done = false;
int delay = 250;

void draw() {
  frameRate(99999);
  int imageCutoff = 1183; // Vertical point to cut the image at. Gotten by printing imageY values while seeing how it's drawn

  if (i == 0) {
    x = VERTICAL_CENTER;
    y = HORIZONTAL_CENTER;
    img = loadImage("orca1.webp");
    imageMode(CENTER);
    imageW = img.width;
    imageH = img.height;
    imageX = 0;
    imageY = 0;
  }

  imageX = i * (int) random(15,60);

  if (imageX > imageW) {
    imageX = 0;
    imageY = imageY + 1;
    i = 1;
    stroke(0, 0, 200, 90);
    x = (int) map(imageX, 0, imageW, xMin, xMax);
    y = (int) map(imageY, 0, imageH, yMin, yMax);
    direction = -1 * direction;
  }

  if (imageY > imageH) {
    println("DONE!");
    done = true;
  }

  color pix = img.get(imageX, imageY);
  int brightness = (int) brightness(pix);

  if (brightness < 50 && !done) {
    x = (int) map(imageX, 0, imageW, xMin, xMax);
    y = (int) map(imageY, 0, imageH, yMin, yMax);
    //drawPoint(y + 500, x -500, 0);
    // drawLine(x + 500, y - 500, (int) random(yMin, yMax), xMax, false, 0); start from bottom?
    int horizontalOffset = 1000;
    int verticalOffset = 500;
    int lineLength = 100;
    int originY = (int) y + verticalOffset;
    int originX = (int) x - horizontalOffset;
    line_clipped(originY, originX, originY + (int) random(10, 20), originX + (int) random(lineLength/2, 2*lineLength), true, delay);
    //line_clipped(y, x, y + (int) random(-10, 20), x + direction*(int) random(50, 100), true, delay);
    lastY=y;
    lastX=x;
  }
  i = i+1;
}
```
