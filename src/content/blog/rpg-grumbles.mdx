# Things that annoy me in RPGS

### When the UI tells you someone's name before the character does

Tiny annoyance, but it takes away from the immersion if you see a character's name in the UI before they introduce themselves. 

### Item titles that take away the mystery 

This happened in Horizon Zero Dawn: Forbidden West, and inspired me to write it down. I was exploring an "ancient ruin" in the post-apocalyptic game, and came across a locked door. 
I had to find a key to open it, and it was unclear what the building was. There's logs etc you can find in the game that give you clues, but when I found the key the game popped up a notification 
with "Hotel Room Key acquired" which kinda ruined the mystery. It would have been nice if the game had just said "Key acquired" and let me figure out what it was for from a vague description 
that fit the setting (how Aloy, the protagonist, would describe it).
