# I no longer can tell what is AI

Youtube's algorithm suggested a video of [Aunt Velma - The Canadian Conspiracy Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzY6c_hMa_U) to me. I watched it all, thought it was funny and well done, and surprised it only had 10 views or so. I read the description of the channel which said it is AI generated.

I didn't realise at all while watching it.
