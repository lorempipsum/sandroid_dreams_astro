## Finished Games

- <span id="aliens-dark-descent">**02/05/2025 - Aliens Dark Descent**</span>-
  Great Aliens game. Sweet atmosphere, and some really unique mechanics. -
  Really liked going back to the same mission several times to finish off
  objectives, and the fact that the map had persistence based on your actions
  e.g. turrets and mines you set up on that map stay there when you go back. -
  Clever mechanics that keep you moving despite mistakes, and forcing you to
  accept a non-perfect run. E.g. alien aggressiveness increasing throughout a
  level, the Stress mechanic that makes your team more likely to panic, the fact
  that you can only save at certain points, and that accumulated damage causes
  time in the medbay for your team. And the global timer that counts down to the
  end of the game. - ChatGPT was really helpful for asking questions about
  mechanics after not having palyed for a while! - Annoyances: - The game
  automatically chooses which member of the team does an action, which is OK
  most of the time, but it made it really difficult to snipe targets with the
  rogue class. - Kinda difficult to keep track which team member is which. And
  maybe too many tabs for barracks / medbay / psychiatry / training to keep
  track of marine statuses.

<br />- **04/05/2025 - Hitman 3** - Didn't like: no smuggled items when you play
a mission for the first time. You have to complete the mission to unlock that
stuff. It limits options and makes the game more linear and less fun imo. - Was
much more fun once I gave up on the idea of optimising the run and just played
to finish the mission however I wanted. E.g. using the sniper rifle in the
second-to-last mission to take out both targets quickly, and not worrying about
exploring or finding other ways to do it. - Having just played <a href="#aliens-dark-descent">
  **Aliens: Dark Descent**
</a> before this, it'd be really interesting if you could go back to the same
map in Hitman and have it change based on your actions. E.g. go into a map to
smuggle in an item, leave, then go back in and retrieve the item to use it. Or
find out what the door codes are etc on one run, maybe eliminiate one target,
and go back later. That would add some more variety and make it less about
trying to optimise one run, and it wouldn't be as repetitive as going back to
eliminate the same targets.{' '}
