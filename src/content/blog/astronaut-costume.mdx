# Astronaut Costume

I'm creating an astronaut costume

## Tools 

The internet recommends https://pepakura.tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura_designer/ for making paper models. Up to now I've bought a helmet model template from the internet and made a prototype with that, but it was too small. Scaling it is kind of difficult as it comes in a PDF, so hopefully using dedicated software makes that easier.
