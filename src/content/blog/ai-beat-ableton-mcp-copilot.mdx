# Using AI to make music with Ableton Live 

Link to MCP: https://github.com/ahujasid/ableton-mcp

LLMs can now control software on your computer using MCPs. Someone had made one for Ableton Live, and I wanted to see how the AI would do at creating a simple beat. I gave it a vague instruction to "create the song of the future", and it took it from there. It figured out which instruments would be appropriate to use, made some loops, and named everything thematically. I think the end result is pretty good!

It's a surprising use of Copilot in VSCode for me, and imo an interesting way to interact with software.
