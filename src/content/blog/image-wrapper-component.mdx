# Different ways of showing images on this site

I'm making a new image display component for this site and this is some documentation of its different parts. 

Not promise to be current or helpful is made. 

Starting with

### The Container 

The image is set to be the width of the paragraphs by default. 

The max-height of the image is 50vh. 

Object-fit is set to 'cover'. (It would be fun to have it automatically select object-position for which part to zoom into)



#### With a 4:3 image

<ImageContainer src={bristol_balloons.src} id="bristol-balloons-jpg" client:only />

#### With a Widescreen image

<ImageContainer src={bristol_balloons_wide.src} id="bristol_balloons_wide-jpg" client:only />

#### with a Portrait image

<ImageContainer src={cloudRailway.src} id="cloud-railway-jpg" client:only />

#### with a Fancy B&W image

<ImageContainer src={bwArtsy.src} id="bwArtsy-jpg" client:only />

#### With a really long pano image 

<ImageContainer src={really_long_pano_sunset.src} id="really_long_pano_sunset-jpg" client:only />
