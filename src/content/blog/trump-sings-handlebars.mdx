Iâ€™ve been reading the news too much lately and it's scary and confusing. I listened to Flobots - Handlebars and was struck that the lyrics could almost verbatim be a POTUS speech in today's economy. So I used https://theaivoicegenerator.com/trump-ai-voice/?selected_voice_id=f2a759a898f449e58bfbb4af37d1dc06#fmtts_3476 and re-wrote the lyrics 120 characters at a time, and then stitched them together in Ableton Live.
