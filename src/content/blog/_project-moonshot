# Project Moonshot

I want to take pictures that incorporate the Moon this year. To make the photos more interesting, I want to include a foreground subject. 

To successfully capture the Moon next to the foreground object with a telephoto lens, it is necessary for the moon to be low in the sky. 

To make sure the foreground object is lit properly, and to make the moon easier to expose for (it is very bright in the night sky), I will need to shoot during sunset or sunrise. 

So, to plan my shots I need to know these things: 

* When does the sun rise and set? 
* At what altitude will the moon be at sunrise and sunset? (An easier question to answer might be "What time will the moon rise and set?" depending on APIs etc)


Bonus: 
* What phase will the moon be in?
* What will the weather be like?

## Current Process 

I have been using the app **PhotoPills** and **Sky Tonight** to plan shots manually. **Sky Tonight** has a really helpful AR feature that shows the path of the Moon and Sun in the sky. 

<ImageWrapperLightBox client:only><Image src={skyTonightScreenshot} alt={"Screenshot of Sky Tonight AR feature"} /> </ImageWrapperLightBox>

PhotoPills has some fancy features like being able to see the path of the moon and sun on a map, and seeing how large the moon will be in the sky at a given focal length and distance. 

<ImageWrapperLightBox client:only><Image src={photoPillsScreenshot} alt={"Screenshot of PhotoPills UI"} /> </ImageWrapperLightBox>

I am not a very advanced user however, and I am sure there are many features I am not using. 

TODO: Check if PhotoPills has an API, a way to export data, or a way to automate the process of planning shots based on my criteria. 

Okay I checked, and it looks like PhotoPills already does Everything I need, maybe:

Here's how to do it:

1. Go to the planner, and set your location where you want to take a photo at
1. Drop the black pin on the map on top of your subject
1. Click the "Find" icon in the bottom left
1. Click "Moon at azimuth & elevation"

## Development 

To make this more fun I have tried to use ChatGPT to make this page for me. 

It's a fairly simple page that I am sure has lots of prior work on it in Github, so I feel like ChatGPT should handle it just fine. 


The first thing I tried was some sort of programming based plugin (or "GPT") called Grimoire. I gave it this prompt: 

```
Hi ChatGPT. Please act as a professional software engineer proficient in web development. I want you to generate the code for the following page in a React app: 



The page shows a full-page calendar with dates, and when a date is selected, it shows this information on the screen for that date: 
* Time of sunrise / sunset
* Time of Moonrise / Moonset
* Height of the moon angle at sunrise / sunset 
* The moon phase
```
