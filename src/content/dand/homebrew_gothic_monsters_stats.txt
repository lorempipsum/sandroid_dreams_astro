# Annelids

### Swamp sharks

Swamp sharks, despite their name are not species of sharks, but rather overgrown carnivore annelids that inhabit marshlands, swamps, mangrove woods and similar flooded areas. 

They may be slow on solid ground, but they are fast as lightning in the water. 

They might not possess any eyes, but esn't mean they would be any less precise bites with their monstrous jawless maws full of tiny razor sharp teeth.

that doThanks to their uncanny ability to blend in the muddy waters of their habitat, they have reputation of appearing seemingly out of thin air in front of unsuspecting victim.

They tend to hunt and rest in groups of less then ten individuals.

# Insects

### Minecrawlers
Minecrawlers appear to be permanently enlarged species of insects akin to ants, or maybe termites. 

They live deep underground, carving their nests into solid stone, through occasionally, they can be spotted above ground when they accidentally dig through the earth to the surface, of when some of their tunnels cave in. 

The *mine* in their name comes from the fact they often breach into mine tunnels, wreaking havoc among the miners. Any mine that had been out of comisson for longer periods of time has more likely then not become fully transforemd into their nests.

Their saliva and mandibles have minor magical properties and thus are sought after by alchemists.

#### Minecrawler drone
Minecrawler drones are the most numerous and the weakest members of the hive. They carve and maintain the tunnels and farm cave mushrooms. They also can mix crushed stone with their saliva to create rather sturdy reddish material out of which they create ramps and tubes when necessary.
When forced to fight, they attack with their sharp-pointed front legs.
#### Minecrawler warrior
Minecrawler warriors, as the name suggest, are warrior caste of the hive. They protect the nest and the queen. There are some accounts of them devouring flesh of percieved threat to the hive, as well as sustaining themselves on the mushrooms, like their drone brethen do. 

Their shell is somewhat harder and more robust then the shell of the drones. In fact, it's hard enough to make a decent armor of. Together with the fact their front legs have transformed into claws, it makes them appear more crustacean-like and less ant-like.

#### Minecrawler queen
Minecrawler queen look more or less like the drones, with the exception of their abdomen being incredibely swollen and overgrown, leaving the queen unable to move on it's own, as it is often the case with hive-based insects. To compensate for that, it's front legs are exceptionaly long.
### Bloodflies

Bloodflies are cat-sized hornet-like flying insects. Not much is known about their social structure, or if they create some sort of hives or nests. They ussually are seen in groups of five to ten. Their primary habitat seems to be marshlands, but they also are often seen in sunny meadows. They sustain themselves on the blood of animals they slay with their poisoned stings.



<br>
<br>
```
```
### Field rairers

Research shows these man-sized beatles might be relatives of the minecrawlers. Unlike the minecrawlers, they don't dwell underground, but rather on the surface. They are individualistic herbivores, and only concentrate on one spot when there is enough food for everyone, for example on fields. Especially corn fields.

When in danger, they stand up on their hind four legs and attack with their shrap-pointed front legs. While they may pose danger to unprepared farmer, they are no match for anything else.

### Meatbug

One could hardly call these slightly overgrown rolly-pollies monsters. They are pretty much harmless and defenseless. They seem to be decomposers, since they often appear near filth or dumps. 

They get their name from the fact they have more meat on them then other insects of their size, meat which is eadible and even tasty, considering what the bug sustains on. Given it's also attracted by filth, is known to be a staple of beggar's diet.

# Reptiles

### Lurkers
These amphibian lizards can be found by any larger body of water. They mainly hunt fishes, but they don't mind changing up their menu by rabbits, deer, or unlucky humanoids. They are not very sociable and larger groups exist only in places of enough water and prey for everyone. 

Their prefered method of hunting is hiding in reeds or tall grass and ambushing unsuspecting prey.

### Snappers

Snappers are man-sized carnivorous reptiles walking on their hind legs. Since their fron legs are atrofied to the point of uselessness and their hind leg talons are not really that sharp, their most potent weapon is their powerful jaw.

While individualy they don't pose much threat, they are rarely found alone. Most of the time they found in groups of five or six members, hunting together and sharing the spoils. 

Snappers are known for the speed of running, as well as their incredible dexterity of movement. They are also known to be quite a nightmare, because while they might not be the best trackers, but once they got their focus on their target, they will follow it to the end of the world. Or at least until they get interested in some better target.

### Dragon snappers
Dragon snappers are variant of normal snappers, if it's the same species or just closely related one is not known. They are stronger and tougher then normal snappers and are frequently found alone, or leading a pack of normal snappers. 

Their name is quite obviously based on their dragon-kin look, but as far as scholars are concerned, they have no real connection to true dragons, or just dragon-kin.

### Lizard

Lizards, are, carnivorous lizards as big as a horse. If you shortned the legs of the horse, that is. 

They might look slow when calm, but the truth is, they are incredibly fast when they want to be and are able to deliver bite after bite before their prey even notices they moved from their original position. 

They live in warm and humid enviroment, usually by bodies of water in forests of Myrtana, by oasis in Varant, on the beaches, or in the tropical jungle of Jakahaktar. They are usually found in groups of five or more individuals.

### Fire lizards
Kin to the lizard, Fire lizards are as big, with distinct leathery sail on their back. The fire in their name comes from the fact they live only in scorching hot enviroment, like by active volcanoes, or in deserts of Varant. 

Also, in addition to the dangers they share with lizards, they breathe fire, making them oponent worthy of more experienced monster hunters. Their tongue is valuable as alchemical ingredient for fire-related potions.

# Mammals

### Trolls

Trolls of Myrtana  are not giant-king with supreme regenerative powers, like creatures of the same name found in Forgotten realms. Rather, they are species of giant apes. They are huge, immensly strong, but kinda ungainly, one could even say clumsy. They are not very bright either. 

All in all, they are not really dangerous foe, if one stays sharp and dodges the rather ungraceful punches. That being said, their punch can send unwary hunter flying.

### Shadowbeasts

Shadowbeasts are great animals, body akin to grizzly bear, head and demeneor of a cat and a rhino-like horn on their head. They are individualistic in nature, and highly territorial, with territories spanning serval miles. They tend to sleep in the most secure and dark location their territory offers, which often means caves.

 There are many things that makes them terrifying as none other creatures: Their bone crushing horn, their maw that tasted many hunters and other prey, their paws that can both crush and slash and transform any living object into a pile of meat and bones and shredded skin, their uncanny cat-like grace in movement, but the most terrifying is probably thir custom to take heads of their victims and pile them up in their lairs. 
 
 Some scholars argue that this is sign of intelect, but the majority views it just as some sort of gaining reputuation ritual, like some birds that collect shiny to show off, and still clasiffy Shadowbeasts as ordinary non-thinking creatures.


### Molerats

Despite being found in nearly every corner of Myrtana, not much is known about these blind, fur-less, omnivore, small dog-sized rodents. 

Their meat is good, and their fat is of exceptional quality, making it prefered type of fat in medicinal and alchemical recepies. Because of this, molerats are sometimes bred and kept as livestock, not unlike pigs. 

Wild molerats tend to live in packs of four to eight individuals. They tend to create nests for themselves in any cave, or under rocky overhangs, they can find. Despite their blindness, they are day creatures, returning to their nests for the night, carrying in any interesting objects, or excess food they found.

# Birds

### Scavangers
These flightless birds are about as tall as humans,  and can be found on meadows, by rivers, in the woods, and pretty much everywhere in Myrtana. There are some tropic variations on some of the islands, but you won't meet them in frozen Nordmar, nor in perched Varant.

As their name suggest, they are primarily scavangers, but they also are known to hunt for worms in the ground, and able to digest seeds. 

Both their meat and their eggs are perfectly edible, but save for few oddballs, nobody thought about farming them. After all, hens are just as good and there is less trouble in keeping them.

# Mystical monsters

### Degauth

Degauth, also known simply as demons, are can be found anywhere you could find any other demon. 

However, their relative lack of cognitive capabilities and strong will makes them one of the easier demons to both summon and control. 

They lack much of the trickery and finesse of other demons, being simply otherwordly brutes of immense strengh.


### Golems

Golems created by mages of Myrtana are more then just animated statues. Rather, they are crude humanoid figures created out of centrain material, animated and infused with elemental magic.  Deep within their artificial body, there is a gem. This gem is called the golem's heart, and is the source of the elemental magic animating the golem. Once the golem crumbles to pieces, among the rubble, the gem will lie, for anybody to take and use however they seem fit.

#### Stone golems
Stone golems tend to look like bunch of boulders that had been glued together and animated. Their heart is infused with the earth element.

Stone golems are nearly invulnerable in battle, and can deliver hefty punch, but they are brittle and a good swing with mage or warhammer can take them down.

#### Fire golems

As the name suggest, the fire golem's heart is infused with fire element. Their body is created of coal that had been fused together and is alight. 

Those walking mounds of embers can put their enemies in flames by mere touch, but their weakness is, as one would expect in magical cold.

#### Ice golems

As the name suggest, the fire golem's heart is infused with cold element. Their body is created of icicles and ice.

Weapons are reported to just slide off these walking icicles, however they seem to melt pretty easily.



> #### Golem hearts
> Golem heart is nearly indestructible small gem. Fire opal for fire elemental, aquamarine for ice golem and onyx for stone golem.
> 
>Aside from golem creation, those gems can be used to cast a simple spell or used as arcane focus.
>
> **Fire golem's heart**(fire opal). As a action, a creature holding this gem can cast *firebolt*.
>
> **Ice golem's heart**(aquamarine). As a action, a creature holding this gem can cast *frostbite*.
>
> **Stone golem's heart**(fire opal). As a action, a creature holding this gem can cast *Gust*.
>
>Casting cantrips imbued to the gem counts as object interaction with the gem.
